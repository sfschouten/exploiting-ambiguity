This would make Option 1 the most likely interpretation.\n\nHowever, there is some ambiguity in the wording of the statement, specifically the use of \"in\" before \"December 1821\". If we interpret this as meaning \"at that time,\" then Option 2 becomes more plausible since Josef Kirpal was indeed the head of state in December 1821 and he was born in Prague according to Premise (P39).\n\nIn summary, while both options could potentially be true depending on how we interpret the statement, Option 1 appears to be more consistent with the available information.","choice":"1"}}
