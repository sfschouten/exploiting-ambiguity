According to P3, Karl Gustav Theodor von Arnim was part of the Guards Rifles Battalion from March 1847 to August 1848, and P8 states that the Guards Rifles Battalion is a military unit of size class battalion. Therefore, in January 1848, Karl Gustav Theodor von Arnim's military unit was of size class battalion. Option 1 is incorrect because P2 states that Karl Gustav Theodor von Arnim was part of the IV Corps from December 1863 to January 1864, and P9 states that the size class of a military unit does not change over time. Therefore, in January 1848, Karl Gustav Theodor von Arnim's current military unit (IV Corps) could not have been of size class battalion.","choice":"2"}}

Therefore, option 1 is not likely.\n\nIf we consider option 2, it would be consistent with premise (P2) which states that Karl Gustav Theodor von Arnim was part of the IV Corps from December 1863 to January 1864, and with premise (P5) which states that IV Corps is a military unit of size class Corps. However, premise (P9) also states that the size class of a military unit does not change over time, so we cannot be sure if IV Corps was of size class Corps back in April 1859. Therefore, option 2 is also not entirely conclusive.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given premises, we cannot know for certain whether or not Karl Gustav Theodor von Arnim's current military unit (IV Corps) was, as of April 1859, of size class Corps.","choice":"1"}}
