According to Premise P1, Q16173603 was registered with Somalia from January 1968 to January 1976. This means that during this time period, Q16173603 was considered a citizen or resident of Somalia. However, according to Premise P2, Q16173603 was also registered with Norway from January 1954 to January 1957. Therefore, at some point before January 1957, Q16173603 must have been considered a citizen or resident of Norway.\n\nBased on these two premises, we can conclude that Q16173603 was living in Norway when it was still part of Europe, which is defined by Premise P5. Since Premise P7 states that countries do not change continents, we know that Norway did not move from Europe to another continent between January 1954 and January 1957. Therefore, if Q16173603 was living in Norway during this time period, then Norway was still part of Europe.\n\nNow, let's look at Premise P3, which tells us that Q16173603 was registered with Germany from January 1957 to January 1968. We know that Q16173603 was already registered with Norway prior to January 1957, so there must be an overlap where Q16173603 was simultaneously registered with both Norway and Germany. During this overlap, Q16173603 would have been considered a citizen or resident of both Norway and Germany.\n\nSince Premise P6 tells us that Germany is a part of Europe, we know that Q16173603 was living in Germany while it was still part of Europe. Therefore, if Q16173603 was living in Germany during the overlap period, then Germany was still part of Europe.\n\nFinally, let's consider Premise P4, which tells us that Somalia is a part of Africa.
