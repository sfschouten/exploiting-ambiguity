This is because P8 states that the size class of a military unit does not change over time, and therefore we can assume that the size class of the 30th Division in January 1871 would be the same as its size class in January 1876. Additionally, P2 tells us that Wilhelm von Woyna was part of the 30th Division from October 1873 to November 1880, which includes the year 1871. Therefore, it is more likely that he was still part of the 30th Division in January 1871 than that he had moved back in time to join the Q106521601, which he left in June 1871 according to P1."}}
