Based on the given premises, we can determine that option 2 is more likely than option 1. Here's why:\n\nOption 1 assumes that the current location of the headquarters (Geneva) was also its location in September 1915. However, according to P10, the headquarters were located in Geneva from January 1981 to January 1991, which is after September 1915. Therefore, this option cannot be correct.\n\nOption 2 states that the headquarters in September 1915 (The Hague) were located in or next to the specified bodies of water. According to P8, the headquarters were indeed located in The Hague during that period. So, this option is consistent with the premises and therefore more likely.","choice":"2"}}

However, according to Premise (P16), Cincinnati is located near the Ohio River, which means that at some point between October 1906 and January 2000, the IWW moved its headquarters from Chicago to Cincinnati. Therefore, if it is currently January 2007, then the IWW headquarters must have been located in Cincinnati during March 1972. Since Cincinnati is not located near Lake Michigan or the Chicago River, option 1 cannot be correct.\n\nOption 2: The headquarters of Industrial Workers of the World in March 1972 (Chicago) were located in or next to the following bodies of water: Lake Michigan, Chicago River.\n\nAccording to Premise (P5), the IWW headquarters were located in Chicago from April 1933 to February 1970. If it is currently January 2007, then the IWW headquarters must have been located in Chicago during March 1972. Since Chicago is located near Lake Michigan and the Chicago River, option 2 is more likely than option 1.","choice":"2"}}
