It follows that his appointment as head coach at Borussia Dortmund must have been based on his previous successes at those clubs.

However, given his track record at other clubs, it seems more plausible that they remained a strong club even after he left.\n\nTherefore, if we consider all these factors together, it appears more likely that the club with Ottmar Hitzfeld as its head coach in August 1995 was Borussia Dortmund rather than FC Aarau or FC Bayern Munich."}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":493,"completion_tokens":375,"total_tokens":868}}],"results":{"choice":"2","explanation":"is correct.
