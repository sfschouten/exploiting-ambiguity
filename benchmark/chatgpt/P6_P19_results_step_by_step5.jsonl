Therefore, it is possible but not likely that the sentence is referring to Chris Watson as the head of state in August 1904 who was born in Valpara\u00edso.\n\nOption 2: Based on premise P5, John Gorton was the head of state in January 1968 to March 1971. September 2016 falls within this period, so it is not possible for Malcolm Turnbull to be the current head of state. Therefore, option 2 is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the most likely interpretation is option 1: Australia's head of state in August 1904 (Chris Watson) was born in Valpara\u00edso.","choice":"1"}}
